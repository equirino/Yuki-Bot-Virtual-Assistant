looks wise yes , play wise no
but we would both pay . to see that . is not he doing stuff for czw ? are not they like extreme stuff , they should do a punjabi prison match with cj parker .
the fire escape is there . you hear wood splintering , and look to see that a raptor has managed to break a hole in the top of the door , just above the dresser . its head pokes through , then disappears . there's another thud , and the dresser moves forward a few inches .

they are honestly really cool , you get used to the 'weirdness' of the design way faster than you might expect , and they really do sound very even and consistent across the whole bass . i am not really a boutique 'coffee table' bass kinda guy , but man , their super p basses http www . dingwallguitars . com basses super p super p gallery make me drool .

touche , nihlium's pretty good . i used to regularly see professor chaos in dm servers , he is a beast .
very mixed feelings . i just quit three weeks ago hard as shit to do and i will admit that i thought it made me some super edgy streetwear god but its honestly terrible for you and so expensive . plus everyone outside of cities that are fashion conscious are going to think you are gross . it is hard to feel cool when girls are curving you over cigarettes . it is definitely an aesthetic thing but i feel like all these young kids who worship ian connor do not really understand how shitty it gets after a while . now that i quit i have so much more money to buy clothes .

that thing hits like a ton of bricks , so i might only take a few , been saving something good for tonight ! ! will do ! next toke is for uncle jesse and the one after that is for gordon .
the only way i know how is to modify the save file so that you ruler was actually born at some point in the future . because the game does not check if the ruler should be alive , it is impossible for him to die until that date . also , it does not check for regency except upon succession , so when the date your ruler is born on occurs you will not get a regency . however , i have no idea how to actually modify a save file .

guys it is finally here nfl network or espn ?
gt i have grown up around firearms and have a homemade range in a field out back , i shoot a ton and have carried on my person around the house for the past years or so . this does not make you prepared to use your gun defensively . it has almost zero bearing on how well you will fare in a real fight for your life . you need the stresses of training and the eye of a competent instructor to evaluate you and help you improve . i am not saying you have to spend thousands of dollars at the top firearms schools in the nation , but just find a decent two day course in your area and sign up for that . it will do wonders for you .
feeling pretty good today . i really like how my hair is looking . planning on going to dinner with my partner tonight at a burger place . my first time out this week after work . this pleases me a lot and i am somehow perversely looking forward to minutes of makeup for a minute meal . p need to buy a electric shaver for like , oclock shadow touchups when i need to put makeup on late in the day . going to avengers on saturday with a bunch of friends who did not know . . . until i told them today . because hell if i am gonna boymode on the weekend . reactions were generally of the 'okay thanks for the heads up' variety . now i am semi nervous about whether they will be nervous around me . i hate my arm hair . so much . abdomen hair , you can go too . today's the third day in a row that the scale read ' ' on the first digit . boymode days left before full time . only minorly freaking out about wardrobe and presentation .

that is creepy o o . i love the navajo culture but i never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc . i did , however , forget one bit . apparently , up until my grandmother moved . she called my mother several times in hysterics , saying that 'yenaldlooshi is outside' or she would leave messages saying 'i am not safe here , i have to leave . i will talk to you soong i do not remember that , i had to ask my mom about it . my mom does not even like to talk about it . i do remember that apparently , several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same , large black dog over the course of several weeks .

we agree completely , you just made it personal and alluded to my needing 'old school parenting' . if you said that to my face i would show you some old school conflict resolution along with a healthy dose of respect for strangers . just because you are behind a keyboard does not mean you can act like a fucktard . just to be clear , i agree with what she did and agree that zero tolerance zero thinking .

this was pretty much my only complaint about the chromas . back in the day , a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the 'bucket fill' option . i think they are a cool idea , but id prefer they be sold separately rather than together . even if all would cost more than the current or what ever it is , id still prefer them being liek each . its like people on video game auctions . you have a stack of say gold each for a total of g of an item , versus a stack of g each for a total of g of an item . the latter is cheaper per unit , but you only need . . . so while i am paying a little more for less , i am overall paying less gold for what i need . same applies here . hell , release them separately for each , and release them also as a bundle where its buy get free kind thing . this makes the pack price , while individually costing total .
my hypothesis journalism realizes that their ship is sinking . they try to use their positions to prove that they are able to bend whatever 'truth' there might be in any shape or direction possible . there is no objectivity , right ? guess that is just healthy business instinct . the real money lies in pr and political spin doctoring and social media astroturfing , not in 'journalism' .
it does not say it , but it can be inferred from the numbers easily . it said that . of hate crimes were committed by whites , and . were black . whites are of the american population , blacks are . . whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats . this is pretty simple math . there are offenders . is offenders rounding up to the next whole number . is offenders rounding up to the next whole number there are , , whites in america there are , , blacks in america we can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get in every whites was charged with a hate crime in in every blacks was charged with a hate crime in this makes blacks . times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites , per capita .

i used to work at a university and one of the professors in the department had a deer ass mounted on her office wall behind her desk . i later found out the story was that she asked her husband for some quirky taxidermy for her birthday she studies material culture , so she probably meant something like this http i . imgur . com wmjxasu . jpg but he got her the deer ass instead . not sure if he did it as a joke or did not actually know what she meant .

i imagine this is all just has to do with tolerance . if you gradually increase your dose then i imagine your tolerance would match it to stop the dose from being strong enough to damage dopamine receptors . again , once you build a tolerance then higher doses will not effect you as much and so the nuerotoxic properties would need an even higher dose to present themselves . seems pretty straight forward .

well according to this polling data http www . gallup . com poll desire children norm . aspx , the desire to have kids has not changed all that much in recent years . i would wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth . remember , when you or anyone was growing up , you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids . you did not see many of the people that did not want kids because they did not want to be around you . that can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually . when you reach adulthood , you see all the people that do not want kids because they are not actively avoiding you anymore . that could account for some of the perceived change .

yeah , you are right that they can affect the health of their children . most fat people probably got their bad habits from somewhere . however i am not so sure that making someone feel like a shitty human being will really help . most fat people are probably well aware that they being fat is not a good thing i guess it would be okay to speak up against those who deny that fact , that is just stupid and a outright dangerous opinion . however , since fatness correlate with a lack of education and low income in many ways fatness is a matter of class i think that maybe there are better ways to be attacking this health problem .

siltfin is an overpriced carddraw mechanic . usually a card like siltfin is meant for a midrange deck , not for an early game deck . coldlights are ofcourse awesome for murloc decks , but since you only have two of them , they are not a reliable card draw engine . also , it increases the chance of your opponent drawing into an answer .

when you are depressed , support that is there for you is not always obvious . the person in question has a number of medical issues going on besides just the emotional aspects . they have legitimate reasons to be sad and upset even without getting into what happened a few days ago . what happened to tina has hit me so hard that i am on a train barely keeping myself together . i am still so worried about tina , and i am also worried about my friend , because more stuff happened to her yesterday and i have not heard from her since then . i am actually terrified . so please . please . i know you are all good people and that you are compassionate . please continue to be so . that is all i can ask for at the moment .
